If a Member (the "Defaulting Member") defaults in making any required Capital Contribution when it becomes due, any other Member may give the Defaulting Member a written notice of such default. If the Defaulting Member fails to make the required Capital Contribution and reimburse all costs, including attorneys' fees, incurred by the Company or the other Members as a result of such default as specified in the default notice, within ten (10) business days after the giving of the default notice, the other Member(s), by the consent of such other Member(s) holding a majority of the Units (other than the Defaulting Member's Units) in the Company (the "Consent of the Non-Defaulting Member(s)"), may authorize and direct the Company to take any action permitted by the Act, including, but not limited to:</p><p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="margin-left:.5in;"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>(3) enforcing the obligation of the Defaulting Member in any Court of the State of <span style="background-color: #aaaaaa; color: #ffffff;">Maine</span>.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left:.5in;">Each Member expressly consents to the jurisdiction of the courts of the State of <span style="background-color: #aaaaaa; color: #ffffff;">Maine</span> for the limited purpose of any action to enforce such Member's obligation to make any required Capital Contribution. If the required Capital Contribution is in a form other than cash, the Company, acting pursuant to the Consent of the Non-Defaulting Member(s), may require the Defaulting Member to contribute cash equal to that portion of the value of the required Capital Contribution that has not been made.

The loan(s) shall bear interest at a rate equal to the lesser of (A) the legal rate, or (B) the prime rate as published in the Wall Street Journal plus three percent (3%), and shall be secured by the Defaulting Member's Membership Units. Each Member hereby grants to the Company a security interest in such Member's Membership Units to secure the timely and full payment and/or performance of his Capital Contribution and irrevocably appoints the Company his attorney in fact for the purpose of executing in his name and filing with the Secretary of State and any other filing office a financing statement evidencing such security interest. Until the loan(s) are fully repaid, the non-defaulting Members who contribute in the Defaulting Member's place shall be entitled to all distributions on account of the Defaulting Member's Membership Units, which shall be applied first costs and expenses of collection, then to accrued interest, and then to principal on the outstanding balances of the loan(s).</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4.4 <u>Distributions, Generally</u>. </p><p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left:.5in;">(a) <u>Cash Distributions</u>. All cash shall be distributed to the Members in accordance
with their Membership Interests.<a href="#fn11" class="fnote" id="ref11" style="background-color: #cd251f; color: #f8f7f3; padding: 0 4px; border-radius: 5px; vertical-align: sub; display: inline-block; height: 15px; margin: 0 2px; font-family: sans-serif; font-weight: 500;"><sup>11</sup></a></p><p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left:.5in;">(b) <u>Tax Distributions</u>. For each of the Company's</span> taxable years, the Company shall, to the extent of available cash and except to the extent precluded by law, make distributions in an amount such that each Member may receive an amount sufficient to pay such Member's federal and state income tax liability on Net Profits allocated by the Company to such Member in said year. Unless a Member can demonstrate that the amount so determined is
insufficient, the amount of such distributions may, at the option of the Company, be calculated on the assumption that all Members are subject to tax at the highest marginal tax rate, both state and federal, but able to utilize fully the deduction for state income taxes provided in Section 164 of the Code. The Company's determination of the distributions pursuant to this paragraph shall be binding and conclusive on all of the Members. </p><p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left:.5in;">It is anticipated that such distributions will be made at such times as will coincide with the Members' obligations to make estimated tax payments. Any overpayment made pursuant to this paragraph during any fiscal year of the Company based upon an overestimate of the projected earnings of the Company shall, at the Company's option, be applied against distributions required to be made by the Company under this paragraph in subsequent fiscal years.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>9.1<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><u>Restrictions on Transfers of Membership Interests</u>. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, no Member may Transfer in any manner whatsoever all or any part of that Member's Membership Interest unless (i)&nbsp;either (A)&nbsp;such Transfer is to a Permitted Transferee or (B)&nbsp;such Transfer has been approved by the Consent of the Members and such Member has fully complied with the provisions of this Article&nbsp;IX for the Transfer, (ii)&nbsp;after giving effect thereto, such Transfer would not otherwise terminate the Company for the purposes of Code Section&nbsp;708 or cause the Company to be classified as other than a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and (iii)&nbsp;such Transfer would not result in a violation of applicable law, including U.S. federal or state securities laws, or any term or condition of this Agreement. Any purported Transfer by a Member or any assignee that is not in compliance with this Agreement is hereby declared to be null and void and of no force or effect whatsoever.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>9.2<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><u>Rights of First Refusal</u>.</p>
<p style="margin-left:.5in;">(a)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>No Member shall Transfer any of the Membership Interests owned by him or her to any third party except (i) following receipt of a bona fide offer from such third party (the "Third Party Offer"), and (ii) unless such Member desiring to make the Transfer (hereinafter referred to as the "Transferor") shall have first extended offers to sell such Membership Interests to the Company and then to the Members on substantially equivalent terms as the Third Party Offer as contemplated by this Section 9.2, and neither the Company nor another Member shall have accepted such offers (the "Right of First Refusal").</p>

<p style="margin-left:.5in;">(b)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><u>Offer by Transferor</u>. Copies of the Third Party Offer shall

shall constitute an offer to sell to the Company or, failing its election to
purchase, then to the Non&#8209;Transferring Members, all of the Membership
Interests then proposed to be transferred by the Transferor (the "Subject
Membership Interests") pursuant to the Third Party Offer, and to which shall be
attached a statement of intention to Transfer to such third party and the name
and address of such third party. </p>
<p style="margin-left:.5in;">(c)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><u>Exercise of Right to Purchase</u></p>
<p style="margin-left:1.0in;">(1)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Within twenty (20) days after the receipt of the offer described in Section&nbsp;9.2(b), the Company may, at its option, elect to purchase all, but not less than all, of the Subject Membership Interests. The Company shall exercise such option by giving notice thereof to the Transferor and to each Non-transferring Member within such 20-day period.</p>
<p style="margin-left:1.0in;">(2)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In the event that the Company does not exercise its option to purchase the Subject Membership Interests within such 20-day period, one or more of the Non-Transferring Members may purchase all, but not less than all, of the Subject Membership Interests by giving notice thereof to the Transferor and to the Company within twenty (20) days after receipt of notice from the Transferor in accordance with Section 9.2 to the effect that the Company did not exercise its option to purchase. The Non-Transferring Members electing to purchase (the "Purchasing Members") shall purchase the Subject Membership Interests pro rata among themselves (based on the Membership Interests owned by each Purchasing Member pursuant to the Purchase Agreement) or as they shall otherwise agree upon among themselves.</p>
<p style="margin-left:1.0in;">(3)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>In either event, the notice required to be given by the Company or the Purchasing Members, as the case may be (the "Purchaser") shall specify a date for the closing of the purchase which shall not be more than thirty (30) days after the date of the giving of such notice.</p>
<p style="margin-left:.5in;">(d)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><u>Purchase Price</u>. Subject to subsection 9.2(e), the purchase price for the Subject Membership Interests shall be the price contained in the Third Party Offer, which price shall be paid in cash or, if so provided in the Third Party Offer, cash plus deferred payments of cash in the same proportions, and with the same terms of deferred payment as therein set forth.</p>
<p style="margin-left:.5in;">(e)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><u>Consideration Other Than Cash</u>. If the offer of Subject Membership Interests under this Section 9.2 is for consideration other than cash or cash plus deferred payments of cash, the Purchaser shall pay the cash equivalent of such other consideration. If the Transferor and the Purchaser cannot agree on the amount of such cash equivalent within ten (10) days after the beginning of the 20-day period under Section 9.2(c)(1), any of such parties may, by three (3) days' written notice to the other, initiate appraisal proceedings under Section 9.2(f) for determination of the cash equivalent. The Purchaser may give written notice to the Transferor revoking an election to purchase the Subject Membership Interests within ten (10) days after determination of the appraised value, if it chooses not to purchase the Subject Membership Interests.</p>
<p style="margin-left:.5in;">(f)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><u>Appraisal Procedure</u>. If any party shall initiate an appraisal procedure to determine the amount of the cash equivalent of any consideration for Subject Membership Interests under Section 9.2(e), then the Transferor, on the one hand, and the Purchaser, on the other hand, shall each promptly appoint as a qualified business appraiser. Each appraiser shall, within twenty (20) days of appointment, separately investigate the value of the consideration for the Subject Membership Interests as of the proposed transfer date and shall submit a notice of an appraisal of that value to each party. Each appraiser shall be instructed to determine such value without regard to income tax consequences to the Transferor as a result of receiving cash rather than other consideration. If the appraised values of such consideration (the "Earlier Appraisals") vary by less than ten percent (10%), the average of the two appraisals shall be controlling as the amount of the cash equivalent. If the appraised values vary by more than ten percent (10%), the appraisers, within five (5) days of the submission of the last appraisal, shall appoint a third qualified business appraiser. The third appraiser shall, within twenty (20) days of his appointment, appraise the value of the consideration for the Subject Membership Interests (without regard to the income tax consequences to the Transferor as a result of receiving cash rather than other consideration) as of the proposed transfer date and submit notice of his appraisal to each party. The value determined by the third appraiser shall be controlling as the amount of the cash equivalent unless the value is greater than the two Earlier Appraisals, in which case the higher of the two Earlier Appraisals will control, and unless that value is lower than the two Earlier Appraisals, in which case the lower of the two Earlier Appraisals will control. If any party fails to appoint an appraiser or if one of the two initial appraisers fails after appointment to submit his appraisal within the required period, the appraisal submitted by the remaining appraiser shall be controlling. The Transferor and the Purchaser shall each bear the cost of its respective appointed appraiser. The cost of the third appraisal shall be shared one-half by the Transferor and one-half by the Purchaser.</p>
<p style="margin-left:.5in;">(g)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><u>Closing of Purchase</u>. The closing of the purchase shall take place at the office of the Company or such other location as shall be mutually agreeable and the purchase price, to the extent comprised of cash, shall be paid at the closing, and cash equivalents and documents evidencing any deferred payments of cash permitted pursuant to Section 9.2(d) above shall be delivered at the closing. At the closing, the Transferor shall deliver to the Purchaser such instruments of transfer evidencing the conveyance of the Subject Membership Interests as Purchaser may require.</p>
<p style="margin-left:.5in;">(h)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><u>Release from Restriction; Termination of Rights</u>. If the offer to sell is neither accepted by the Company nor by any Member, the Transferor may make a bona fide Transfer to the prospective transferee named in the statement attached to the offer in accordance with the Third Party Offer, subject to the provisions of Section 9.3, <u>provided</u> that (i) such Transfer shall be made only in strict accordance with the terms stated in the Third Party Offer and (ii) the transferee agrees, in writing, to be bound by the provisions of this Agreement. If the Transferor shall fail to make such Transfer within sixty (60) days following the expiration of all Right of First Refusal rights set forth in Section 9.2, such Membership Interests shall again become subject to all the restrictions of this Section 9.2.</p>
<p style="margin-left:.5in;">(i)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><u>Limitations</u>. The provisions of this Section 9.2 shall not apply to Transfers pursuant to Article VIII, provided that such transferee agrees to be bound by the provisions of this Agreement as if such transferee were an original Member.</p>
<p style="margin-left:.5in;">(j)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><u>Compliance with Securities Act</u>. Notwithstanding anything contained in this Section 9.2, no Transfer shall be permitted <u>except</u> as may be allowed, in the sole judgment of the Members, pursuant an existing registration under the Securities Act or an exemption to such registration pursuant to Regulation D under the Securities Act (or any successor regulation), and pursuant to similar exemptions from registration under any applicable state or other securities laws.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>9.3<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><u>Substitute Member</u>. No assignee shall have the right to become a substitute Member (a "Substitute Member") upon Transfer of any Units to it unless all the following conditions are satisfied:</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left:.5in;">(a) The Member and the assignee shall have executed and acknowledged such other instruments and taken such other action as the Members shall deem reasonably necessary or desirable to effect such substitution, including, without limitation, the execution by the assignee of an appropriate amendment to this Agreement;</p>
<p style="margin-left:.5in;">(b) The conditions set forth in thisArticle IX shall have been satisfied, and, if requested by the Company, the Member or the assignee shall have obtained an opinion of counsel satisfactory to the Company; and </p>
<p style="margin-left:.5in;">(c) The Member or the assignee shall have paid to the Company such amount of money as is sufficient to cover all expenses incurred by or on behalf of the Company in connection with such substitution. </p><p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>9.4<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><u>Assignee's Rights</u>. </p><p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left:.5in;">(a) Unless an assignee becomes a Substitute Member in accordance with the provisions of Section 9.3 and other relevant provisions of this Agreement, it shall not be entitled to any of the rights (including voting rights) granted to a Member hereunder or under the Act, other than the right to receive the share of distributions and any other items attributable to a Member's Units to which its assignor would otherwise be entitled.</p>
<p style="margin-left:.5in;">(b) Any Member that Transfers all of its Units shall cease to be a Member.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>9.5<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><u>Tax Matters</u>. On the transfer of all or part of any Units, at the request of the assignee of the Units, the Members may cause the Company to elect, pursuant to Code Section&nbsp;754 to adjust the tax basis of the properties of the Company as provided by Code Sections&nbsp;734 and 743. </p><p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>9.6<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p>10.1<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><u>Dissolution</u>. The Company shall be dissolved upon the occurrence of any of the following
events:</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left:.5in;">(a) with the consent of all of the Members; or</p>
<p style="margin-left:.5in;">(b) as ordered by a court of competent jurisdiction.</p>
<p style="margin-left:.5in;">If there is an event of dissolution, the Company shall cease to carry on its business, except insofar as may be necessary for the winding up of its business, but its separate existence shall continue until a Certificate of Cancellation has been filed with the Secretary of State or until a decree dissolving the Company has been entered by a court of competent jurisdiction.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>10.2<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><u>Winding Up, Liquidation and Distribution of Assets</u>.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left:.5in;">(a) <u>Appointment of Liquidator</u>. Upon dissolution, the Members shall immediately proceed to wind up the affairs of the Company in accordance with the requirements of the Act and other applicable law. In furtherance of the winding up of the Company, the Members shall appoint a liquidator, who may but need not be a Member. The liquidator shall wind up and liquidate the Company in an orderly, prudent and expeditious manner in accordance with the following provisions of this Section.</p>
<p style="margin-left:.5in;">(b) <u>Duties and Authority of Liquidator</u>. The liquidator shall make adequate provision for the discharge of all of the Company's debts, obligations and liabilities. The liquidator may sell, encumber or retain for distribution in kind any of the Company's assets. With respect to any asset the liquidator determines to retain for distribution in kind, the liquidator shall allocate to the Members' Capital Accounts the amount of gain or loss that would have been recognized had the asset been sold at its fair market value.</p>
<p style="margin-left:.5in;">(c) <u>Final Distribution</u>. Consistent with Schedule C, the liquidator shall distribute any assets remaining, after the discharge or accommodation of the Company's debts, obligations and liabilities, first, in accordance with the positive Capital Account balances of the Members, as determined after taking into account all Capital Account adjustments for the Company's taxable year during which the liquidation occurs, then, to the holders of Common Units in accordance with Membership Interests. The liquidator shall distribute any assets distributable in kind to the Members in undivided interests as tenants in common. A Member whose Capital Account is negative shall have no liability to the Company, the Company's creditors or any other Member with respect to the negative balance.</p>
<p style="margin-left:.5in;">(d) <u>Required Filings</u>. Upon the completion of the distribution of the Company's assets to the Members, the liquidator shall file with the <span style="background-color: #aaaaaa; color: #ffffff;">Maine</span> Secretary of State such instruments and take such other actions as are necessary or appropriate to effectuate the
cessation of the Company's existence. </p><p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>10.3<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><u>Certificate of Cancellation</u>. Upon completion of the winding up, liquidation and distribution of the assets, the Company shall be deemed terminated and the Members shall forthwith file with the Secretary of State a Certificate of Cancellation. Thereafter, the Members, as liquidating trustees, shall have authority to distribute any Company property discovered after termination, convey real estate and take such other action as may be necessary on behalf of and in the name of the Company.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>10.4<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><u>Return of Capital Contribution - Nonrecourse</u>. Except as provided by law or as expressly provided in this LLC Agreement, upon dissolution, each Member shall look solely to the assets of the Company for the return of his or her Capital Contribution. If the Company property remaining after the payment or discharge of the debts and liabilities of the Company is insufficient to return the Capital Contribution of a Member, such Member shall have no recourse against any other Member. </p><p>&nbsp;</p>

<ul class="fnote">
	<li class="fnote"><a name="fn01">1. </a>I believe this is "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boilerplate_%28text%29">boilerplate</a>" disclaimer-ese that reminds the reader: "Buyer Beware"<br /><a href="#ref01" id="1">BACK TO BOILERPLATE</a><br /><br /></li>
	<li class="fnote"><a name="fn02">2. </a>Specify a default percent above which any share vote will be considered a "majority" decision, ideally no less than 50%. Throughout the rest of this document this phrase -- "Consent of the Members" is used and references this default percentage. There are a few areas -- such as dissolution -- at which the Consent percentage is specified as other than the default percentage. An altered percentage of Consent can be applied anywhere else in the document where members must decide something, otherwise you stick to this default rate.<br /><br />
	What, you might ask, is an appropriate default rate? That calls for a very personal and situation specific answer that I can't give you. The answer has many ramifications that should be thoughtfully considered. This is one easy area where the advice of a legal professional would be a benefit, especially in identifying ALL areas of Consent and what would be an appropriate figure. We used 75%.<br /><a href="#ref02" id="2">BACK TO CONSENT DEFINITION</a><br /><br /></li>
	<li class="fnote"><a name="fn03">3. </a>This is the minimum number of shares voting to act on something within the FC<br /><a href="#ref03" id="3">BACK TO MAJORITY INTEREST</a><br /><br /></li>
	<li class="fnote"><a name="fn04">4. </a>Often abbreviated as "<a href="https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#q=define%3A%20jtwros">JTWROS</a>".<br /><a href="#ref03" id="4">BACK TO MEMBER DEFINITION</a><br /><br /></li>
	<li class="fnote"><a name="fn05">5. </a>Often this function is fulfilled by a lawyer, or another trusted third-party who has officially registered with the Secretary of State as a corporate agent to an unlimited number of entities. But it can also be the role (paid or unpaid) of a member appointed by all the members. The difference is the appearance of impartiality vs. the cost of a lawyer's time to do the minimum amount of work required to keep the LLC registered and current. In Maine it costs around $150 for annually registering an LLC with the State of Maine, and you will pay at least double that amount to a lawyer who will do this (and other organizational work, as well as a retainer for potential work like answering a question on the phone...) for you.<br /><a href="#ref05" id="5">BACK TO REGISTERED AGENT</a><br /><br /></li>
	<li class="fnote"><a name="fn06">6. </a>This is an important distinction IF Initial Members of the LLC will have separate or special rights under the terms of the LLC or a purchase and sale agreement.<br /><a href="#ref06" id="6">BACK TO INITIAL MEMBERS</a><br /><br /></li>
	<li class="fnote"><a name="fn07">7. </a>Members can agree, initially, to issue any number of units and how to divide them. Obviously (or not) these units have value upon issue directly tied into the assumed or assessed value of the property (land, structures, equipment, etc.) transferred into the LLC initially. For example, an LLC that owns a property assessed or assumed to be worth $10,000 could issue 100 shares which would each have an assessed/assumed value of $100 at the time of issue. Or members could decide to issue 10,000 shares to facilitate fine-grained fractional transfer. Be aware, however, that property value, especially in the form of real estate, changes over time, so five yeras after a $1/share valuation at issue the share value could be less or more than $1. If it's important for members to stick to a $1/share valuation this <em>could</em> be done periodically (see 3.3(b) Issuance of Additional Membership Units) but I don't know of a good reason to spend the money and effort necessary to track and adjust this very often.<br /><a href="#ref07" id="7">BACK TO MEMBERSHIP UNITS</a><br /><br /></li>
	<li class="fnote"><a name="fn08">8. </a>Before deciding to issue additional shares to existing or new members the membership should be familiar with the concept of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_dilution">share dilution and the possible fallout for existing members when issuing new shares of a fixed value asset. <br /><a href="#ref08" id="8">BACK TO ADDITIONAL UNITS</a><br /><br /></li>
	<li class="fnote"><a name="fn09">9. </a>In the eyes of the law, an LLC is a "business" and thus may have profit and/or loss distributions to its members that must be organized and accounted for (see Schedule C for the complete tax rules spelled out). How "profit-y" or "non-profit-y" an LLC is run is up to the members. Folks interested in a strictly non-profit model may want to look into <a href="http://legislature.maine.gov/statutes/13/title13sec1742.html">Housing Cooperative entity</a>, which vary in definition and function from state to state in the US, and encompass a very different legal framework.<br /><a href="#ref09" id="9">BACK TO PROFITS AND LOSS</a><br /><br /></li>
	<li class="fnote"><a name="fn10">10. </a>This is a super important -- if unpleasant -- section. Capital contributions may occasionally be necessary to repair or replace an important part of the LLC. Members are <em>responsible</em> for doing this if the LLC mandates the maintenance of something that disappears or is damaged. This is where the ramifications for this responsibility are s-p-e-l-l-e-d out, hopefully in a compelling way that short-circuits any thoughts by one member of getting around it.<br /><a href="#ref10" id="10">BACK TO CAPITAL CONTRIBUTION</a><br /><br /></li>
	<li class="fnote"><a name="fn11">11. </a>Maybe this is obvious, or maybe it is only obvious to me. In most cases the LLC works according to <strong>shares</strong> not individual members. So one member who owns 50% of shares has 50% of the votes, gets 50% of distributed profits, and is responsible for 50% of expenses, even if there are four other members who all own some other percentage of shares (because they are splitting the remaining 50%). Members participate in an LLC with their shares. Couples who own shares together (see "JTWROS" above) may vote those shares together, or may decide (themselves, and informally) to separately vote a percentage of their jointly-owned shares. (That said the actual ownership of each share remains "JTWROS" for purposes of transfer, etc...this is where a lawyer is probably waving their arms and shouting that I should stop typing immediately...!) <br /><a href="#ref11" id="11">BACK TO PREVIOUS</a><br /><br /></li>
	<li class="fnote"><a name="fn12">12. </a>The key phrase here is that "The Members may..." delegate one person to act on behalf of all the members. This would be done for expediency, and this entire section makes it clear that any delegated member cannot make decisions that have not already been approved the the Consent of the Members. What this section allows to happen is to compel only one person to sign papers or represent the LLC at a meeting of some kind. Some LLCs may prefer that ALL members be present when ANY business of the LLC is conducted. So this allows for different styles in the management of an LLC. And just below this there are also provisions for delegating a small group ("committee") of members to conduct business for the LLC as instructed by the Consent of the Members.<br /><a href="#ref12" id="12">BACK TO MANAGEMENT</a><br /><br /></li>
	<li class="fnote"><a name="fn13">13. </a>In fustier versions of LLC documents, the only non-face-to-face meeting option is buy telephone. Obviously there are now more options of holding a meeting across distances if necessary, so this is an attempt to embrace the technology of 2015...<br /><a href="#ref13" id="13">BACK TO MEETING BY A/V CONF</a><br /><br /></li>
	<li class="fnote"><a name="fn14">14. </a>Unpleasant to consider, perhaps, but very necessary to plan for handling.<br /><a href="#ref14" id="14">BACK TO PREVIOUS</a><br /><br /></li>
	<li class="fnote"><a name="fn15">15. </a>It's very important to understand that that shares of an LLC are NOT like shares of a publicly traded company on a stock exchange. One cannot simply purchase and sell on a whim. The transfer of shares, therefore, is not free-flowing, which is a benefit to the remaining members, but certainly a burden on members looking to "dissociate" which could, possibly (see "Buyer Beware" above), affect the real value of shares for the potential buyer. As numbingly dense as this section appears, this is an important section to review and understand before becoming a member by any means.<br /><a href="#ref15" id="15">BACK TO PREVIOUS</a><br /><br /></li>
	<li class="fnote"><a name="fn16">16. </a>Also unpleasant but necessary. It's actually reassuring to me to know that once unleashed an LLC does not join the ranks of the un-dead in perpetual search of new members...it can be killed, and here is how to do it effectively and fairly.<br /><a href="#ref16" id="16">BACK TO DISSOLUTION</a><br /><br /></li>
	<li class="fnote"><a name="fn17">17. </a>Just as important as a path to dissolution (if that becomes necessary) is a method for improvement of this Agreement. And it's so simple!<br /><a href="#ref17" id="17">BACK TO AMENDMENT</a><br /><br /></li>
	<li class="fnote"><a name="fn18">18. </a>Obviously (or perhaps only to me) documents such as this example of a "Forestry Management Plan" should be distributed to members whenever generated and/or updated to be (ideally) filed together with a copy of the agreement. <br /><a href="#ref18" id="18">BACK TO FORESTRY PLAN</a><br /><br /></li>
	<li class="fnote"><a name="fn19">19. </a>This is a real and very useful service. Most states also have soil testing services (public and private), but you are not limited to using your own state's testing service if you find another one that you like. <br /><a href="#ref19" id="19">BACK TO SOIL TESTING</a><br /><br /></li>
	<li class="fnote"><a name="fn20">20. </a>1 acre. <br /><a href="#ref20" id="20">BACK TO 43,560 sq.ft.</a><br /><br /></li>
